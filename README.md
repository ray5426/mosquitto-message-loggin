# mosquitto-message-loggin
This repository hosts a custom plugin for the Mosquitto MQTT broker. The plugin logs message payloads received by the broker into CSV files, capturing payload data along with timestamps. It provides an example of extending Mosquitto's functionality through plugins, demonstrating how to integrate custom logging features into MQTT message handling.
